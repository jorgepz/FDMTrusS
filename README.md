# FMTS: an UNDER-VALIDATION Force Method Truss Solver

## What is FMTS?

FMTS is a GNU-Octave/Matlab code for solving 2D truss problems using the Force Method.

## Why?

The purpose of this repo is to provide an example of a computational implementation of the [Force Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_dummy_force_method) for 2D truss structures. The code is oriented to undergraduate Civil Engineering students, in particular students at [Facultad de Ingeniería, UdelaR](https://www.fing.edu.uy/) in Uruguay.

## How to use it?

 1. download and unzip the code https://github.com/jorgepz/Force-Method-TrusS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
 1. open GNU-Octave or Matlab and move to the `examples` folder and run one of the scripts

## How it works?

The mechanics of the code and the theory of the method are based on the textbook of the course Resistencia de Materiales 2, publicly available at [this repo](](https://gitlab.fing.edu.uy/jorgepz/libroResMat2/)).

## Who?

By the moment this code is being developed by [Jorge Pérez Zerpa](https://www.fing.edu.uy/~jorgepz/), but any contribution is welcome.
